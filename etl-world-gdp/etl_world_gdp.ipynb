    "### Introduction\n",
    "In this practice project, you will put the skills acquired through the course to use and create a complete ETL pipeline for accessing data from a website and processing it to meet the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Scenario:\n",
    "An international firm that is looking to expand its business in different countries across the world has recruited you. You have been hired as a junior Data Engineer and are tasked with creating an automated script that can extract the list of all countries in order of their GDPs in billion USDs (rounded to 2 decimal places), as logged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since IMF releases this evaluation twice a year, this code will be used by the organization to extract the information as it is updated.\n",

    "\n",
    "URL\n",
    "`'https://web.archive.org/web/20230902185326/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "- You have to complete the following tasks for this project\n",
    "- Write a data extraction function to retrieve the relevant information from the required URL.\n",
    "- Transform the available GDP information into 'Billion USD' from 'Million USD'.\n",
    "- Load the transformed information to the required CSV file and as a database file.\n",
    "- Run the required query on the database.\n",
    "- Log the progress of the code with appropriate timestamps."
