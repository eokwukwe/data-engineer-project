# Hands-on Lab: Build an ETL Pipeline using Bash with Airflow

> Apache Airflow Final Assignment of Course 8 of 13 in the [IBM Data Engineering Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-engineer)

## Scenario

You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with a different IT setup that uses different file formats. Your job is to collect data available in different formats and consolidate it into a single file.

## Objectives

In this assignment you will create a shell script using bash commands to:

- Extract data from a csv file
- Extract data from a tsv file
- Extract data from a fixed width file
- Transform the data
- Load the transformed data into a new csv file

You will then create a DAG to call the shell script.
